MASKING and DATA COLLECTION
____________________________

(1) Download the National Landcover Database 2011 Database
(2) Warp the coordinate system
(3) Run maskData.py to get the coordinates of the state of interest (using coordinates from IDs/) with the land use of interest
(4) Run createMakeflow.py if you want to distribute the collection of data with Makeflow (http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/makeflow/)
(5) Makeflow will execute MakeRequests.py and DataProcessing.py to download the climate data and format it into CSVs
(6) Run mergeCSVs.py to concatenate historical and future climate data
