Final project for Team DEET

This project aimed to predict mosquito abundance using future climate predictions and visualize mosquito 
populations from 1950 to 2099.

[Historical (1950 - 2005) and future prediction (2006 - 2099) data](http://climate.nkn.uidaho.edu/MACA/data_csv.php) for each 'developed' latitude and longitude coordinate in Arizona was collected and run through a [mosquito abundance model](https://github.com/JocelineLega/MoLS) to predict daily mosquito numbers based on near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and surface relative humidity.

Monthly average mosquito abundance was visualized using the [QGIS time manager plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/timemanager/).

For more information about the code and more detailed instructions for setup and running, see [the project wiki](https://github.com/ksaxberg/final_teamAZ/wiki).
