Using rcp45_36.99_-113.63.csv as the test data set.

Have cut the file up into 5 single year sections, and one 5 year collection.

This is to be used with the script Run_Timing.py to provide information
about runtimes on whatever computer configuration is setup. Run_Timing.py
should be run through a makeflow program, as the only file of interest
coming from the timing script is timing.txt. Requires MoLS to be in the same
folder.
