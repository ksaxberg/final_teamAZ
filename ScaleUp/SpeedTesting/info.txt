Using rcp45_36.99_-113.63.csv as the test data set.

Have cut the file up into 5 single year sections, and one 5 year collection.

This is to be used with the script Run_Timing.py to provide information
about runtimes on whatever computer configuration is setup. Run_Timing.py
should be run through a makeflow program, as the only file of interest
coming from the timing script is timing.txt. Requires MoLS to be in the same
folder when run, which Get_MoLS.sh takes care of.

For LocalRun.makeflow:

makeflow LocalRun.makeflow
    Will produce a file timingsLocal.csv
    Represents 5 single year runs, and one 5 year run
    Single, local worker


For RemoteRun.makeflow:

makeflow -T wq -N timingTest RemoteRun.makeflow -p $PORT 
    Will produce several timing files, timingsRemote${i}.csv
    Each represents the output of a worker on 5 single year, 1 five year
    Meant to check with multiple workers on a single computer the effect of scaling
    
    To change the number of tasks, remove/add lines (Maybe script this going forward)
