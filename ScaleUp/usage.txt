----- Still Testing something ------
Can makeflow handle relative addressing?
What happens to that thing through this.
Assuming it will work well.
------------------------------------

To run this whole thing, pass in the folder containing csvs as a command line input to makeMakeflow.py:

python makeMakeflow.py folder/of/interest

Then from this folder, it should be as simple as running the makeflow command

=====No idea what it will be in its final form
makeflow Makeflow.makeflow
